# Architectural Proposal

1. **Proposed Architecture:**

    ### Web-based, Multi-tier Client-Server Architecture

    - **Presentation Layer (Client Side)**
        - **Web-based Interface:** This layer interacts with the user, runs on the web, making it compatible with most devices → can handle the criteria of a Windows desktop computer.
        - **Timecard Integration:** The sensor will be connected to a computer or network → allows data transmission.

    - **Application Layer (Server Side):** The server layer is responsible for processing input data. This is a centralized server that can handle over 5,000 users.

    - **Data Layer**
        - **Database Management:** A powerful database system will store all current employee data, time logs, and generated salaries.
        - **Integration with Legacy Systems:** Dedicated modules or APIs are responsible for connecting legacy systems (including PMS and banking systems).

    ### Advantages of This Architecture for the System

    - **Platform Compatibility:**
        - Since the application is web-based, it inherently runs on Windows-based desktops and individual employee computers with minimal requirements (a web browser and internet connectivity).
    - **Global Accessibility:**
        - Hosting the server on a cloud platform or using content delivery networks (CDNs) can improve access speed for employees around the world.
    - **Performance and Scalability:**
        - The architecture can handle over 5,000 employees by distributing the load across multiple servers if necessary.
        - Load balancers can manage network traffic efficiently, preventing any single point of failure.
    - **Security:**
        - Secure communication protocols (like HTTPS) will protect data transmission between clients and the server.
        - Authentication and authorization mechanisms will ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.

2. **Proposed Architectural Mechanisms**

    **1. Scalability Mechanisms**

    - **Load Balancing:** To distribute network traffic across multiple servers, preventing any single server from becoming a bottleneck and ensuring efficient handling of over 5,000 employees globally.
    - **Horizontal Scaling:** To allow the system to scale out by adding more servers as the number of users grows, enhancing performance and capacity.

    **2. Integration Mechanisms with Legacy Systems**

    - **API Gateways and Middleware:** To enable seamless communication between the new system and existing legacy databases and banking systems without altering them.
    - **Message Queuing Systems:** To ensure reliable and asynchronous communication with legacy systems, handling data exchange efficiently even if the legacy systems don't support modern protocols.

    **3. Security Mechanisms**

    - **Authentication and Authorization:** To ensure that only authorized employees can access appropriate data and functionalities, enhancing security through role-based access control.
    - **Encryption:** To protect sensitive data during transmission and storage using HTTPS with SSL/TLS and encrypting data at rest.
    - **Audit Logging:** To monitor system access and changes, aiding in security compliance and troubleshooting.

    **4. Data Management Mechanisms**

    - **Database Replication and Synchronization:** To ensure data consistency and high availability across global locations through strategies like master-slave or multi-master replication.
    - **Caching:** To improve system performance by reducing database load and speeding up data retrieval using in-memory caching systems.

    **5. User Interface Mechanisms**

    - **Responsive Web Design:** To provide a consistent and user-friendly interface across various devices and screen sizes using responsive design frameworks.
    - **Localization and Internationalization:** To support multiple languages, date formats, and currency symbols for a global user base.

    **6. Fault Tolerance and Reliability Mechanisms**

    - **Redundancy:** To prevent system downtime by using redundant servers and network paths, ensuring continuous availability.
    - **Automatic Failover:** To maintain system availability by automatically switching to standby servers if primary ones fail.

    **7. Performance Optimization Mechanisms**

    - **Asynchronous Processing:** To improve responsiveness by handling time-consuming tasks like report generation in the background using background job processing systems.
    - **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):** To reduce latency for global users by serving static assets from servers closest to them.

    **8. Maintainability and Extensibility Mechanisms**

    - **Modular Architecture:** To simplify maintenance and allow easy addition of new features by designing the system with well-defined, independent modules.
    - **Microservices Architecture (if applicable):** To break down the application into smaller services that handle specific business functions, enhancing scalability and flexibility.

    **9. Compliance and Audit Mechanisms**

    - **Compliance with Standards:** To adhere to legal and industry regulations like GDPR by implementing necessary data protection mechanisms.
    - **Reporting and Analytics:** To provide management with insights and ensure transparency through advanced reporting tools and dashboards.

    **10. Testing and Quality Assurance Mechanisms**

    - **Automated Testing:** To ensure system reliability and catch issues early in the development process.
    - **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** To streamline the deployment process and ensure consistent application builds.
