# Subsystem Context Diagram - PrintService

## Key Components in the Diagram

### PayrollController (&lt;&lt;control&gt;&gt;)
- The `PayrollController` is the initiating component of the payroll process.
- It interacts with the `PrintService` through the `IPrintService` interface to request the printing of paychecks.
- The `PayrollController` handles the overall payroll workflow, including deciding when to print paychecks.

### IPrintService (&lt;&lt;Interface&gt;&gt;>)
- This interface serves as a contract between the `PayrollController` and the `PrintService`.
- It defines a single operation, `printPaycheck(aPaycheck: Paycheck)`, which is invoked by the `PayrollController` to print paychecks.
- The interface allows for loose coupling between the `PayrollController` and the implementation of the printing process.

### PrintService (&lt;&lt;Subsystem proxy&gt;&gt;)
- The `PrintService` is the subsystem responsible for handling the actual printing operations.
- It implements the `IPrintService` interface and provides the concrete functionality for printing paychecks.
- As a subsystem proxy, it encapsulates the complexity of managing printing tasks and interacts with other entities like the `Printer` and the `Paycheck`.

### Paycheck (&lt;&lt;entity&gt;&gt;)
- Represents the data structure containing information about an employee's paycheck.
- The `PrintService` accesses this entity to retrieve the details required for printing the paycheck.

### Printer (&lt;&lt;entity&gt;&gt;)
- Represents the external printing hardware or system.
- The `PrintService` sends print jobs to the `Printer` to physically generate the paychecks.

---

## Relationships and Interactions

### PayrollController → IPrintService
- The `PayrollController` uses the `IPrintService` interface to request the printing of paychecks.

### IPrintService ← PrintService
- The `PrintService` implements the `IPrintService` interface, exposing the `printPaycheck` method to external components.

### PrintService → Printer
- The `PrintService` sends print jobs to the `Printer`, which handles the actual printing of the paychecks.

### PrintService → Paycheck
- The `PrintService` accesses the `Paycheck` entity to retrieve paycheck details (e.g., employee name, amount, date) necessary for formatting and printing.

### IPrintService → Printer / Paycheck
- The `IPrintService` interface indirectly interacts with the `Printer` and `Paycheck` through the `PrintService` implementation.

# Subsystem Context Diagram - Project Management Database

## Key Components in the Diagram

### Employee (&lt;&lt;actor&gt;&gt;)
- The primary user interacting with the system. Employees perform tasks such as maintaining timecards, submitting timecards, and generating reports.

### TimecardSystem (&lt;&lt;control&gt;&gt;)
- Handles operations related to timecards, including creating, updating, and submitting them.
- Serves as the control class for interactions involving the Project Management Database.

### ReportSystem (&lt;&lt;control&gt;&gt;)
- Manages report creation and saving. Allows employees to generate reports like "Total Hours Worked" and "Total Hours Worked for a Project."

### Project Management Database (&lt;&lt;subsystem proxy&gt;&gt;)
- A subsystem responsible for storing and managing charge numbers (i.e., project-related codes).
- Provides functionality to retrieve charge numbers and store project-specific data.

### Charge Number (&lt;&lt;entity&gt;&gt;)
- Represents the project codes or charge numbers that employees use to allocate hours worked.

### Timecard (&lt;&lt;entity&gt;&gt;)
- Represents an individual employee's record of hours worked, associated charge numbers, and submission status.

### Report (&lt;&lt;entity&gt;&gt;)
- Represents the various reports generated by employees, such as "Total Hours Worked" or "Total Pay Year-to-Date."

---

## Relationships and Interactions

### Employee → TimecardSystem
- The Employee interacts with the TimecardSystem to maintain and submit timecards.

### Employee → ReportSystem
- The Employee interacts with the ReportSystem to generate reports.

### TimecardSystem → Project Management Database
- The TimecardSystem retrieves charge numbers from the Project Management Database when employees maintain or submit timecards.

### ReportSystem → Project Management Database
- The ReportSystem retrieves charge numbers from the Project Management Database when generating project-specific reports.

### TimecardSystem → Timecard
- The TimecardSystem creates, updates, and submits the Timecard entity.

### ReportSystem → Report
- The ReportSystem generates and optionally saves the Report entity.

### Project Management Database → Charge Number
- The Project Management Database stores and retrieves Charge Number entities.
